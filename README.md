rain forecasting using deep neural networks
Methodology
1.1	Data Collection and Preprocessing
The initial step of our analysis involves the collection and preprocessing of the historical rainfall data. The dataset is loaded from a provided CSV file. To ensure data quality, any occurrences of -999 values are replaced with NaN (Not a Number) values, signifying potential missing or outlier data. The date-related columns (YEAR, MO, DY) are combined into a unified datetime format named ’Date’. Column renaming is performed to adhere to the required ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model format, resulting in the new columns ’date’ and ’precipitation’. The ’date’ column is then designated as the index of the DataFrame, facilitating chronological analysis.
Subsequently, the data is resampled to a weekly frequency, with precipitation values aggregated on a weekly basis. Any remaining gaps in the data are filled with zeros to ensure a consistent dataset suitable for subsequent analysis.
1.2	Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA
The crux of our methodology involves the application of the ARIMA model for time series forecasting. ARIMA is a widely employed technique for modeling and predicting time-dependent data. We harness this model to predict future precipitation trends based on historical patterns.
Initiating the forecasting process, we establish the forecast period, which extends beyond the existing dataset to encompass the years up to 2028. The count of forecast periods (weeks) is computed based on the commencement and conclusion dates of the forecast.
We embark on an iterative approach, wherein for each forecast period, the following steps are undertaken:
1.	Selection of a rolling window containing historical data, encompassing the weeks leading up to the present forecast period.
2.	Fitting of an ARIMA model to the selected historical data. The order of differencing (p,d,q) is determined based on data characteristics.
3.	Utilization of the fitted ARIMA model to forecast precipitation for the upcoming week.
4.	Appending of the forecasted value to a list denoted as forecast values.
1.3	Visualization and Interpretation
With the forecasted precipitation values at hand, we proceed to visualize and interpret the outcomes. A plot is generated to illustrate both the historical precipitation data and the projected values. The historical data is depicted via a blue line, while the forecasted values for future weeks are represented by a red line. To provide enhanced context, adjustments are made to the x-axis labels, y-axis labels, title, and legend.
This visualization facilitates the assessment of forecast accuracy and offers insights into potential trends and variations in forthcoming precipitation patterns. Any disparities between the projected and actual data serve as valuable input for refining our forecasting model and enhancing the precision of future predictions.
In summary, our methodology encompasses data preprocessing, ARIMA modeling, iterative forecasting, and visual interpretation to prognosticate future
